# Dapr 1.9.2

### Fixes panics when using pubsub subscriptions or input bindings via gRPC with tracing disabled

#### Problem

Users who disabled tracing and are subscribing to Dapr pubsub components via gRPC or using input bindings via gRPC will encounter panics when an event is attempted to be delivered.

### Impact

This issue impacts users who:

- Disabled tracing (sampling rate is set to 0, not the default Dapr config sets this to 1)
- Use input bindings via gRPC and/or subscribe to pubsub components via gRPC

#### Root cause

A code refactor of a tracing utility function previously required by changes in our upstream tracing libraries changed the return signature from a pointer to a value. Several `nil` checks were missing in the code resulting in panics. This previously presented no concern because a method call on a nil pointer is a `no-op` in Go.

#### Solution

We have added the missing `nil` checks to correctly handle the case where tracing is diabled.
