# Dapr 1.10.1

## Fixes regression in Cloud Event fields "id" and "source"

### Problem

1.10 introduced a regression in pub/sub where publishing a message resulting in the runtime creating a new cloudevent envelope would set the Dapr app-id to the `id` field in the envelope instead of a UUID value, and the `source` field would be set to `"Dapr"` irrespective of the app-id producing the event.

### Impact

This impacts Dapr users who publish messages and who are not using custom cloud events and/or raw paylods.

Impacted Dapr version is 1.10.0.

### Root cause

The regression was introduced with [this](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/commit/75046d6f40759206cc248811a42f72aaeaccc206#diff-743bbf07ae27eb655bc6849c12459c29d0789aa5009c628ad6c67925b02c54ffR55) change.

### Solution

We adjusted the change and added tests to capture the correctness of the `id` field for the scenario where Dapr is required to produce a new cloud event.
